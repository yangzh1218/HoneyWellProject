<p>Camera and cell phone should be under the same Wi-Fi. Choose the Wi-Fi with strong signals. Keep suitable distance with the router. Enter correct Wi-Fi passwords to connect camera with internet quickly. Following issues may result in failure of camera network configuration:</p>

<p>1.	Enter correct Wi-Fi account and password</p>  
<p>Failure to connect camera with internet probably caused by incorrect Wi-Fi account or password. Please do not enter space and complex or uncommon symbols.</p>
</p>

<p>2. Several ways to judge whether bind failure is caused by router setting
<p>
（1）The router has set Wi-Fi anti-loiter network mode
If the Wi-Fi the camera connected has set anti-loiter network mode (e.g. Black and white list, MAC address filtering), it will lead to the camera failed to connect with internet. Cancel the router anti-loiter network setting is necessary.</p>

<p>
（2）The router has set 5GHz bands Wi-Fi
 The camera does not support 5GHz bands Wi-Fi. Please enter the admin page (admin page address is normally at the bottom of the router tag) of the router to choose 2.4GHz bands. </p>

<p>
（3）If your Wi-Fi is bridge connected, suggest to use non-bridge connected Wi-Fi, because bridge connection may cause unstable network.</p>
</p>

<p>3. Check whether cell phone allows iCam APP to access flow data, WLAN.
<p>If the camera is not allowed to access flow data, WLAN, it will cause the camera cannot connect with Wi-Fi
Solutions (Android phone): open [Setting], click [Application Management], find [Wulian iCam], choose [Authority Management], choose [Allow to turn on Wi-Fi], [Allow to use mobile network]. </p>
